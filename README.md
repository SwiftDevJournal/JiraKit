# JiraKit

Swift data structures for Jira's REST API v3.

I ran the [create-api command line app](https://github.com/CreateAPI/CreateAPI), supplying a JSON file for Jira's REST API. JiraKit is the Swift Package that create-api generated.

## Requirements

* Swift 5.5+
* iOS 13+
* macOS 10.15+
* tvOS 13+
* watchOS 6+
